## Conclusion
Recommendation systems are data filtering tools that make use of data, algorithmns, and different techniques to recommend the most relevant items to all kinds of users. They help users get personalized recommendations. They are an important tool in e-commerce sites.  They are used in a variety of fields including movies, music, videos, books, online shopping, restsurants, news and various others. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Amazon Kindle, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Flipkart, Ebay are all recommendation systems. All social networking sites are recommendation systems. Movie recommendation systems help users decide which movies to watch instead of them wasting time deciding what to watch. The system implemented in our project is based on the collaborative filtering algorithm along with matrix factorization method. However, we have used opinion mining and clustering to incorporate the user's opinion at the fine-grained level to improve the prediction accuracy of recommendation system. They help overcome the problem of information overload. Movies are recommended to users based on the reviews, ratings, and feedback given by them. It depends on their previous interaction with the system. The goal is to provide the most accurate recommendations in the least possible time.
